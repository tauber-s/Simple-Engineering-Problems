DPK09 Filter
Create a function that can filter a list based on a given condition.

filter([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], (x) => x % 2 == 0) -> [2,4,6,8,10]
The filter function should recive a collection(list or array) and a function that will be apply to each element of the collection.

Now refactor the code and do not use any prebuild function.
